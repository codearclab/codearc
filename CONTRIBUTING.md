# Contributing Guideline

Looking to contribute something to Codearc? **Here's how you can help.**

Welcome to the contributing guide for Codearc! We appreciate your interest in contributing to our open source project.

*Pull requests, bug reports, and all other forms of contribution are welcomed and highly encouraged!*

## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/codearclab/Codearc/issues) is
the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests)
and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following
restrictions:

- Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests.  [our GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/codearclab/codearc/discussions)

- Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

- Please **do not** post comments consisting solely of "+1" or ":thumbsup:".
  Use [GitHub's "reactions" feature](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)
  instead. We reserve the right to delete comments which violate this rule.

## Issues assignment

The core team will be looking at the open issues, analyze them, and provide guidance on how to proceed. **Issues won't be assigned to anyone outside the core team.** However, contributors are welcome to participate in the discussion and provide their input on how to best solve the issue, and even submit a PR if they want to. Please wait that the issue is ready to be worked on before submitting a PR, we don't want to waste your time.

Please keep in mind that the core team is small, has limited resources and that we are not always able to respond immediately. We will try to provide feedback as soon as possible, but please be patient. If you don't get a response immediately, it doesn't mean that we are ignoring you or that we don't care about your issue or PR. We will get back to you as soon as we can.

## Issues and labels

Our bug tracker utilizes several labels to help organize and identify issues. Here's what they represent and how we use them:

- `browser bug` - Issues that are reported to us, but actually are the result of a browser-specific bug. These are diagnosed with reduced test cases and result in an issue opened on that browser's own bug tracker.
- `confirmed` - Issues that have been confirmed with a reduced test case and identify a bug in blnkoo.
- `docs` - Issues for improving or updating our documentation.
- `feature` - Issues asking for a new feature to be added, or an existing one to be extended or modified.
- `help wanted` - Issues we need or would love help from the community to resolve.
- `js` - Issues stemming from our compiled or source JavaScript files.

For a complete look at our labels, see the [project labels page](https://github.com/codearclab/codearc/labels).

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to _you_ to make a strong
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.
